            <h2>Just a guy from Cleveland, as I like to say.  I got my start in media during my time at the University of Akron where I fell in love witih radio when I started on air at WZIP.  From there, my career was set.  During this time, I also did work with the Akron RubberDucks, and CBS Radio.  After Akron, I moved on to get my Master's degree in Communication Theory and Analytics from Cleveland State University.  At the same time, I worked for Rubber City Radio Group as on-air talent for WQMX and WONE.  Later, I became the morning show producer for WQAL where I was responsible for all content on the morning show.  Currently I am focused on creating more radio content, and diving into other areas of the media field including voice work and web design, along with areas such as media relations.  Being creative is what I do best, and I love putting hard work into everything I do.</h2>
